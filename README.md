# spelling-bee

This is a multiplayer spelling bee game that I have been developing.

I still haven't decided whether I want the code public yet, but you can view the app here: http://play.spelling-bee.xyz/

It is written in: Node.js, Socket.IO, and Bootstrap + Standard Web.

It's a work in progress (alpha stage), just as an fyi.
