# spelling-bee

This is a multiplayer spelling bee game that I have been developing.

I still haven't decided whether I want the code public yet, but you can play the game here: http://play.spelling-bee.xyz/

It is written in: Node.js, Socket.IO, and Bootstrap + Standard Web.

The back-end uses Node, Express, Socket.IO, and MongoDB.

The front-end uses JQuery/JS/Socket.IO and Bootstrap + Standard Web.

I parsed the GCIDE dictionary for word, definition, etymologies, etc...

I used Golang to scrape pronunciations from various sources.

This is still in Beta (and uses free hosting/DB) so it's a bit slow right now, but still very functional. By playing you are helping me determine appropriate difficulty scores for each word so games can be adjusted to player(s) skill. Thanks and enjoy!
